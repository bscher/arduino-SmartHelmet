## About

The Smart Helmet is a motorcycle add-on kit that uses proximity sensors and a heads-up-display on the driver's helmet to unobtrusively warn the driver of potentially deadly hazards lurking in blind spots.

It does this by using proximity sensors to scan an area behind the rider and gather proximity information of surrounding objects to determine if other vehicles or hazards are close by. The system will wirelessly sent this data to the helmet module to be displayed in a heads-up-display.
